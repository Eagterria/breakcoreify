# breakcoreify

Turns any song into endless breakcore.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* FFmpeg
* NumPy

## Usage

```bash
python3 breakcore.py INPUT_FILE.mp3 OUTPUT_FILE.mp3
```

* INPUT_FILE.mp3: Any local song in audio form that you want to convert into breakcore.
* OUTPUT_FILE.mp3: The outputted audio file path.

## Disclaimer

This is a simple script, initially written in a couple of hours, and as such, the breakcore that one may hear might not be an accurate or high-quality representation of what breakcore is like. My goal was only for it to at least be halfway listenable as background music, for studying and such.
